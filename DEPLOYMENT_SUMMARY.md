from showdown_gym.showdown_environment import SingleShowdownWrapper
from stable_baselines3 import DQN

# Create environment
env = SingleShowdownWrapper(team_type="random", opponent_type="random")

# Train agent
model = DQN("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Custom environment setup
from colab_environment import setup_colab_environment

# Setup optimized environment
env_manager = setup_colab_environment()

# Get environment info
info = env_manager.get_colab_info()
print(f"GPU Available: {info['gpu_available']}")
```
